                <h1> In a time filled with uncertainty and darkness, the question that has popped up for us is: what can we do about it? How do we celebrate the life and culture of Palestine and Palestinians? 
                    This is where PaliFest comes in. It's a 3 day celebration of culture and opportunity. Guests can come and learn about Palestinian culture, and be treated to live music, food, movies, and traditional dance.

# PaliFest
by Brandon Zeidan
# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a website that advertises a festival. In this case, PaliFest, a three day festival that celebrates the culture of Palestine, while also educating the masses about what's going on in Palestine. 
# Technical Overview
- Creating a rough wireframe on Figma
- Creating a rough sketch
- Using VSC (Visual Studio Code)
- Adding/fine-tuning transitions

These are what would be used to create this website for this festival
